ðŸ”¢ Counter Class Using cls in Python
This project showcases the use of class variables and the cls keyword in Python to keep track of how many objects (instances) of a class have been created.

ðŸš€ Features
Tracks the total number of objects created using a class variable.

Uses a class method to access and display the count.

Demonstrates how to use cls for working with class-level data.

ðŸ§  Concepts Covered
Class variables vs. instance variables

@classmethod decorator

The cls keyword for referring to the class

Object instantiation in Python
"""
ðŸ“„ Code Example
class Counter:
    count = 0  # Class variable to track number of objects

    def __init__(self):
        Counter.count += 1  # Increment count when a new object is created

    @classmethod
    def display_count(cls):
        print(f"Number of objects created: {cls.count}")

# Create instances of Counter
obj1 = Counter()
obj2 = Counter()
obj3 = Counter()
"""
# Display the total number of objects created
Counter.display_count()  # Output: Number of objects created: 3
âœ… Sample Output
javascript
Copy
Edit
Number of objects created: 3
ðŸ“‚ How to Run
Copy the code into a Python file, e.g., counter.py.

Run the script in a terminal or IDE:
"""
bash
python counter.py
"""
Youâ€™ll see how many objects were created.

ðŸ“Œ Notes
You can modify the script to track other types of events or object types.

This pattern is useful in logging, object pooling, and performance monitoring.
