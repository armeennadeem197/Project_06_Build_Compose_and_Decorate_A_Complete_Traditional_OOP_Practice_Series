# ðŸ“š Book Manager in Python

A simple interactive Python program that demonstrates the use of **class methods**, **class variables**, and **object creation**.

This project is designed as part of learning **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Python â€” specifically focusing on how to use `@classmethod` and `cls`.

---

## ðŸ”§ Features

- Create books with a name.
- Track the total number of books added.
- Display messages when a new book is added.
- Exit the program gracefully with a summary.

---

## ðŸ§  Concepts Covered

- `@classmethod` usage
- Class variables (`total_books`)
- Object instantiation inside a class method
- Input handling with a loop

---

## ðŸ’¡ How It Works

1. The program asks the user to enter book names.
2. Each time a book is added:
   - A new `Book` object is created.
   - The total book count is incremented.
3. When the user types `"exit"`, the program stops and shows the total books created.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

Make sure you have Python installed.

```bash
python main.py


ðŸ§ª Sample Output
ðŸ“– Welcome to the Book Manager!
Type 'exit' to stop adding books.

Enter book name: Python Basics
ðŸ“š Book 'Python Basics' created.
ðŸ”¢ Total books: 1

Enter book name: OOP in Python
ðŸ“š Book 'OOP in Python' created.
ðŸ”¢ Total books: 2

Enter book name: exit

 Final book count: 2

ðŸšª Exiting...
