ðŸš— Car Class with Public Variables and Methods in Python
This Python script demonstrates how to define and access public variables and public methods using a simple Car class. Public members can be accessed directly from outside the class.

ðŸ§¾ Features
Defines a public variable brand.

Defines a public method Start() to simulate starting the car.

Accepts user input to dynamically create car objects.

ðŸ§  Concepts Covered
Public attributes in Python classes

Method definition and access

Object instantiation and interaction

Using self to assign instance variables

ðŸ’» Code Example
"""
class Car:
    def __init__(self, brand):
        self.brand = brand  # Public variable

    def Start(self):
        print(f"{self.brand} is starting...")  # Public method

# Creating an object with user input
my_car = Car(input("Enter the car brand: "))
print("Car Brand:", my_car.brand)
my_car.Start()
"""

âœ… Sample Output
Enter the car brand: Toyota
Car Brand: Toyota
Toyota is starting...

ðŸ“‚ How to Run
Save the code in a Python file, e.g., car.py.
Run the file in your terminal or IDE:
"""
python main.py
"""
Enter a car brand name when prompted.

ðŸ“Œ Notes
In Python, all variables and methods are public by default unless specified with a leading underscore (_) or double underscore (__).

You can modify this code to add more attributes like model, color, or year.
