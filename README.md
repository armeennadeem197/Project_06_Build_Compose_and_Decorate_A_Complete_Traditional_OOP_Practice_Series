# Python OOP Practice Series – Traditional Object-Oriented Programming

This series of folders includes hands-on assignments to build a strong foundation in Python’s object-oriented programming. Each folder contains code focusing on a specific OOP concept.

---

## 📁 01. Using self
- Demonstrates the use of `self` to access instance variables and methods.
- Learn how `self` binds the data to the current object.

---

## 📁 02. Using cls
- Uses the `@classmethod` and `cls` keyword.
- Teaches how to create class methods and modify class-level data.

---

## 📁 03. Public Variables and Methods
- Shows how public variables and methods can be accessed from outside the class.
- Ideal for understanding basic encapsulation.

---

## 📁 04. Class Variables and Class Methods
- Explores the difference between instance and class variables.
- Learn how to create and use class methods.

---

## 📁 05. Static Variables and Static Methods
- Demonstrates static methods that don't rely on class or instance data.
- Helpful for utilities or shared logic.

---

## 📁 06. Constructors and Destructors
- Learn about the `__init__` constructor and `__del__` destructor methods.
- Understand object lifecycle management.

---

## 📁 07. Access Modifiers: Public, Private, and Protected
- Covers how to define variables as public, protected (`_`), and private (`__`).
- Explains Python’s name mangling for private members.

---

## 📁 08. The super() Function
- Demonstrates inheritance and the use of `super()` to call a parent class constructor.
- Useful for building on existing class behavior.

---

## 📁 09. Abstract Classes and Methods
- Uses the `abc` module to define abstract base classes and methods.
- Forces derived classes to implement specific methods.

---

## 📁 10. Instance Methods
- Shows how to define and use methods that belong to an object (instance).
- Learn how to operate on instance data.

---

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes
- Master core OOP concepts in Python.
- Practice with real examples.
- Understand the difference between instance, class, and static contexts.
- Build confidence using inheritance, access control, and abstraction.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open any folder (e.g., `06. Constructors and Destructors`)
2. Run the `main.py` or provided script using:

```bash
python main.py
